## This is simply a structural placeholder of the master branch, nothing to do yet.

## How to use Git (Just in case someone forgot)

a) Navigate to the directory you want to work in.    

b) Clone the repository by running "git clone https://Valamorde@bitbucket.org/Valamorde/cod-ticket-monster.git" (without quotes in CMD, PowerShell or GitBash etc.)    

c) Open the new folder (cod-ticket-monster) in explorer or CD through CMD, PowerShell, GitBash    

d) Run "git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]"    

e) Do what you need to do    

f) When done run "git status", "git add [name_of_the_file_you_want_to_stage_or_period_for_all]", "git commit -m '[your_message_here_KISS]'", "git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]"    

g) You're done.    


## Important

a) We are following the Git Workflow (master, develop, release, feature(s))    

b) On a daily basis before doing anything run "git fetch origin [name_of_your_branch]" followed by "git pull origin [name_of_your_branch]" to make sure you re not having any conflicts    

c) At the end of the day always commit and push your changes.
