## Important Guidelines

a) We are following the Git Workflow (`master`, `develop`, `release`, `feature(s)`)    

b) On a daily basis before doing anything run `git fetch` followed by `git status` & `git pull origin [name_of_your_branch]` to make sure you re not having any conflicts    

c) Follow project structure _at all times_. **Only commit & push the files that will be merged**    

d) At the end of the day always commit and push your changes! **Make sure to add a proper commit message**    

e) To ensure you enjoy the benefits of _git_ make sure to use **GitBash**.
